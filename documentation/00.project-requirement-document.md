## **Product Requirements Document: "Analyst AI" Investment Platform**

*   **Author:** T3 Chat (in collaboration with Patrik Braborec)
*   **Status:** Draft
*   **Version:** 1.0
*   **Date:** 6/11/2025

### **1. Introduction & Problem Statement**

Individual investors often struggle to synthesize vast amounts of information, blend it with their own evolving insights, and apply disciplined, time-tested investment principles consistently. The research process is often fragmented across notes, spreadsheets, and news articles. This leads to missed opportunities, emotional decision-making, and a lack of a systematic approach to both discovering and managing investments.

This document outlines the requirements for "Analyst AI," a web application designed to solve this problem by serving as an intelligent "second brain" for investing. It will provide a unified platform for a user to conduct AI-assisted research, codify their personal knowledge, and manage their investment pipeline based on a foundation of proven investment philosophies.

### **2. Goals & Objectives**

*   **Primary Goal:** To empower the user to make more rational, data-driven, and confident investment decisions.
*   **Objective 1:** Reduce the time and friction involved in researching a new investment idea.
*   **Objective 2:** Create a seamless workflow for capturing and structuring personal investment insights.
*   **Objective 3:** Systematize the investment process by integrating established principles (e.g., from investment literature) into the analysis and decision-making flow.
*   **Objective 4:** Provide active, intelligent monitoring for current investments to support hold/sell/buy decisions.

### **3. User Persona**

*   **Name:** Patrik
*   **Role:** Engineer, Product Manager
*   **Characteristics:** Technologically savvy, analytical, and values systematic processes. He is a lifelong learner who accumulates knowledge daily and seeks to apply it effectively. He appreciates well-designed UX and pragmatic technical solutions that prioritize speed and flexibility.
*   **Needs:** A tool that respects his intelligence, augments his thinking process with AI, and provides a structured yet flexible environment to build and manage his investment theses.

### **4. Core Features & Epics**

The application will be structured around three primary views, each catering to a distinct user mindset.

#### **Epic 1: The Explore View (The Research Notebook)**

This view is for open-ended research, brainstorming, and discovery. It is designed to be the starting point for new ideas.

*   **US-1.1:** As a user, I want an interactive, notebook-style interface where I can ask questions in natural language about sectors, industries, or companies.
*   **US-1.2:** The system shall provide an "Analyst AI" assistant that answers my questions by synthesizing information from its general knowledge base (investment books) and real-time financial data.
*   **US-1.3:** The AI's responses and my questions shall be organized into conversational "cells" within a persistent notebook that can be saved and revisited.
*   **US-1.4:** The AI shall be able to reference my previously saved personal insights when relevant to a query.
*   **US-1.5 (Smart Handoff):** When a company is mentioned in the notebook, I want to see a `[+]` button to add it to my management pipeline. This action must offer to parse the relevant notebook content to create the initial set of insights for that company's analysis page.

#### **Epic 2: The Pipeline View (The Management Hub)**

This view is for the structured management of all companies the user is tracking.

*   **US-2.1:** As a user, I want to see all my tracked companies in a single, unified table.
*   **US-2.2:** Each company in the table must have a `Status` field that can be changed directly in the view. The statuses are: `Idea`, `Researching`, `Ready to Invest`, `Invested`.
*   **US-2.3:** The table shall display key, at-a-glance information for each company, including Price, Daily Change, and a summary of the latest insight. For `Invested` stocks, it must show my P&L.
*   **US-2.4:** Clicking on a company row shall open its detailed "Living Overview" page in a side pane, without navigating away from the main pipeline view.
*   **US-2.5:** Changing a status to `Ready to Invest` must trigger the "Investment Gauntlet" (see Section 5.2).
*   **US-2.6:** Changing a status to `Invested` must prompt me to enter transaction details (date, shares, price) to enable P&L tracking.

#### **Epic 3: The Knowledge Hub (The AI's Brain)**

This view is the command center for managing the system's knowledge base and my own.

*   **US-3.1:** As a user, I want to see the list of investment books and sources that power the Analyst AI.
*   **US-3.2:** I want to view and enable/disable the pre-defined investment checklists (e.g., Graham's Defensive Investor).
*   **US-3.3:** I want a searchable and filterable interface to review all the personal insights I have ever entered into the system, across all companies.

### **5. System-Wide Features & Requirements**

#### **5.1. The Living Overview (Company Detail Page)**

This is the detailed analysis page for a single stock, opened from the Pipeline View.

*   **Content:** Must display an AI-generated summary, a stream of the user's personal insights, a dynamic SWOT analysis, checklist adherence scores, and key financial data tables.
*   **Dynamic Updates:** The AI summary and SWOT analysis must automatically update when the user adds a new insight.

#### **5.2. The Investment Gauntlet**

A formal analysis report triggered when a stock's status is changed to `Ready to Invest`.

*   **Content:** Must include a detailed checklist adherence report (showing which rules were met/unmet), an AI-powered risk analysis (devil's advocate view), and a scan for contradictions in the user's own notes.

#### **5.3. The Invested Watchtower (Alerts)**

An active monitoring system for all stocks in the `Invested` status.

*   **Alert Triggers:** The system must generate alerts for:
    *   **Price Drop:** When a stock's price drops below a user-configurable percentage threshold.
    *   **Fundamental Decay:** When a company's fundamentals change after an earnings report, causing it to fail a key checklist item.

### **6. Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs)**

*   **Data Source:** The system must use a premium financial data API providing at least 15 years of historical financial statements and advanced calculated metrics (e.g., ROIC).
*   **Data Latency:** Real-time price data is not required for the MVP, but financial statement data must be updated promptly after new filings are released.
*   **Architecture:** The system will be built using a composable architecture, leveraging managed SaaS solutions for commodity components (Auth, DBs, Hosting) to maximize development velocity. All integrations must use abstraction layers to prevent vendor lock-in.
*   **Technology Stack:**
    *   **Backend:** Python (FastAPI)
    *   **UI Library**: React
    *   **Routing**: TanStack Router. Chosen for its type-safety and framework-agnostic approach, enabling a flexible SPA architecture.
    *   **Build Tool**: A modern bundler like Vite is recommended to complement this stack.
    *   **Databases:** PostgreSQL-compatible (e.g., Supabase) for structured data and a managed Vector DB (e.g., Pinecone) for RAG.
    *   **AI:** A major foundational LLM (e.g., Google Gemini).

### **7. Out of Scope for MVP**

To ensure a focused and timely initial release, the following features will be deferred:

*   User creation of custom checklists and rules.
*   Customizable views/tabs within the Pipeline View.
*   Direct uploading of new books/sources to the Knowledge Hub by the user.
*   Advanced social features or collaboration.
*   Mobile-native application.

### **8. Success Metrics**

The success of the MVP will be measured by:

*   **User Engagement:** Daily/weekly active use; number of new insights added per week.
*   **Workflow Adoption:** Number of companies moved from `Researching` to `Invested`.
*   **Qualitative Feedback:** Direct feedback from Patrik on whether the tool increases his confidence and improves his decision-making process.

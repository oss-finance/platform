Welcome to your new TanStack app! 

# Getting Started

# Building For Production

```bash
pnpm build
```

## Testing

This project uses [Vitest](https://vitest.dev/) for testing. You can run the tests with:

```bash
pnpm test
```

## Styling

This project uses [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/) for styling.

## Shadcn

Add components using the latest version of [Shadcn](https://ui.shadcn.com/).

```bash
pnpx shadcn@latest add button
```

## Routing

This project uses [TanStack Router](https://tanstack.com/router). The initial setup is a file based router. Which means that the routes are managed as files in `src/routes`.

### Adding A Route

To add a new route to your application just add another a new file in the `./src/routes` directory.

TanStack will automatically generate the content of the route file for you.

Now that you have two routes you can use a `Link` component to navigate between them.
